# Introduction

This part involves some basic stochastics process knowledge. 

Most content of `01~04` describes the continuous stochastics process, coming from the contents of the Statistics Process course(2020 Spring) in [INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS AND BIG DATA, RUC](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/) and [Stationary Stochastic Processes](https://www.amazon.com/Stationary-Stochastic-Processes-Applications-Statistical/dp/1466557796) of [Georg Lindgren](http://www.maths.lth.se/matstat/staff/georg/).
