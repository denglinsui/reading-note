# R

## Tips

- melt data, create several copies:

  ```R
  library(reshape)
  mdata <- melt(mydata, id=c("id","time"))
  ```

  - Here, `id` and `time` are maintained, other variables represents the value but for different objects.

  - A simple example is:

    The original table:

    | id   | TIME | X1   | x2   |
    | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
    | 1    | 1    | 3    | 2    |

    The transformed table:

    | ID   | TIME | Variable | Value |
    | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- |
    | 1    | 1    | X1       | 3     |
    | 1    | 1    | X2       | 2     |
    |      |      |          |       |

- facet plot

  ```R
  p <- ggplot(data = Full_result, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = variable))+
    geom_boxplot()+
    facet_grid('p+exchange ~ rho')
  ```

  - `p+exhange` is the row split method
  - `rho` is the column split method
