# Description

This page collects data that is used in network. 

*Note*: When the data collected is abundant enough, I will categorize them (I hope I will).

# Collections of data

## [UCINet](http://www.analytictech.com/ucinet/)

UCINet includes a lot of well known smaller scale datasets:

- the Davis Southern Club Women dataset
- Zachary’s karate club dataset
- Sampson’s monk data.

## [Pajek](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/)

Pajek contains a larger set of small and large networks from domains such as biology, linguistics, and food-web.

## [mejn](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/)

include power grid networks, US politics, cellular and protein networks and
others  

## [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/)

Stanford Network Analysis Package collects large and very large directed and undirected networks in the areas of communication, citation, internet and others.

# Data Set

## Sampson’s "Monastery" Study  

This is a classic example of a social network derived from the survey administered by Samspon and published in his doctoral dissertation. 

It studies, in direct anthropological observations, the tight factions among the novices who were were preparing to join a monastic order.

## The Enron Email Corpus  

On December 2, 2001, Enron Corporation filed for bankruptcy and were investigated. During the investigation, the courts subpoenaed extensive email logs from most of Enron’s employees, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) published the database online.  

The original FERC dataset contains 619,446 email messages (about 92% of Enron’s staff emails), and the [cleaned-up CALO dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) contains 200,399 messages from 158 users.  

[Another version of the data](https://www.isi.edu/~adibi/Enron/Enron.htm) consists of the contents of the mail folders of the top 151 executives, containing about 225,000 messages covering a period from 1997 to 2004.

## The Protein Interaction Network in Budding Yeast  

 The budding yeast is a unicellular organism that has become a de-facto model organism for the study of molecular and cellular biology. The 6,000 proteins in budding yeast interact in a number of ways, such as binding together to form protein complexes.

Currently, there are four main sources of interactions between pairs of proteins that target proteins localized in different cellular compartments with variable degrees of success:  

- literature curated interactions;
- yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction assays;
- protein fragment complementation (PCA) interaction assays;
- tandem affinity purification (TAP) interaction assays.

## [The Add Health Adolescent Relationship and HIV Transmission Study](http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth  )

The study focused on patterns of friendship, sexual relationships, as well as disease transmissions. To date, four waves of surveys have been collected:

- Wave I(1994-1995):  included 90,118 students from 145 schools across the country.  
  - Form: in-school questionnaire ;  in-home interview additionally(20,745 students)
  - Content: family background, school life and activities, friendships, and health status + sexual behavior;
- Wave II(1996): covered 14,738 adolescents and 128 school administrators. 
  - Form: in-home interview.
- Wave III(2001-2002): Of the original Wave I in-home respondents,
  15,170 were interviewed again for Wave III.
  - Content: marriage,  childbearing, and sexually transmitted diseases + HIV tests(13,184 participants)
- Wave IV (2007-2008): the original Wave I respondents.
  - 92.5% were located and 80.3% were interviewed  
  - Content: social, emotional, spiritual, and physical aspects of health  

## The Framingham "Obesity" Study

It described the evolution of the "clustering" of obesity in this social network.

Participants completed a questionnaire and underwent physical examinations (including measurements of height and weight) in three-16 year periods beginning 1973, 1981, 1985, 1989, 1992, 1997, 1999.

## [The NIPS Paper Co-Authorship Dataset](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~roweis/data.html  ) 

There are 2,037 authors and 1,740 papers with an average of 2.29 authors per paper and 1.96 papers per author, ranging from 1987 to 1999.
