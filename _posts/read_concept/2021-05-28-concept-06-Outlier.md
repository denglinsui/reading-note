# Outlier

Some prevalent definition of outlier:

**Hawkins-Outlier**

An outlier is an observation that deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicion that it was generated by a different mechanism.

**DB(pct,dmin)-Outlier**

An object $p$ in a dataset $D$ is a $D B(p c t, d m i n)$ -outlier if at least percentage pct of the objects in $D$ lies greater than distance dmin from $p$, i.e., the cardinality of the set $\{q \in D \mid d(p, q) \leq\operatorname{dmin}\}$ is less than or equal to $(100-p c t) \%$ of the size of $D$.

where $d(p,q)$ measures the distance between object $p$ and $q$ and $d(p,C)$ measures the distance between object $p$ and set $C$.

*Note*: This counts the number of the objects locates in the ball with centered $p$ and radius $dmin$.
