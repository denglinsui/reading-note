# Description

> In statistics, a **confounder** (also **confounding variable**, **confounding factor**, or **lurking variable**) is a variable that influences both the [dependent variable and independent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables), causing a [spurious association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_relationship). Confounding is a [causal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality) concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations.

In another word, the relationship between independent variable and dependent variable might come from a confounder.

There are several types:

1. Operational confounding
2. Procedural confounding
3. Person confounding

# Example

- The fact that lung cancer happens more on men is possibly because men is more likely to smoke.
- The relation between birth order and the presence of Down Syndrome in the child may result from the maternal age because higher maternal age is directly associated with Down Syndrome in the child.

# How to decrease

- Case-control studies
- Cohort studies
- Double blinding
- Randomized controlled trail
- Stratification
- controlling for confounding by measuring the known confounders and including them as covariates in multivariable analysis such as regression analysis.
