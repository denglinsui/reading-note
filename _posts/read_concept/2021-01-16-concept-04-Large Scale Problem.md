# Example with Clustering Effect

- **fMRI**: The significant test statistics cluster in anatomically relevant regions of the brain;
- **Allele Frequencies**: Genetic loci correspond to physical locations on the chromosome;
- **Variation in DNA**: Methylation fraction across specific genomic region;
- **Neural Spike-Train**:  Electrodes fall at known locations on a two dimensional lattice.
  -  Multiple electrodes are now a standard tool in neuroscience research that make it possible to study the simultaneous activity of several neurons in a given brain region or across different regions
- **Environmental Sensor Networks**: Detect spatially localized anomalies
