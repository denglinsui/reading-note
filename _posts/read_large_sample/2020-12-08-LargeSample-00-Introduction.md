# Introduction

This part involves some basic stochastics process knowledge. 

All of them coming from the contents of the Large Sample Theory course(2020 Fall) in [INSTITUTE OF STATISTICS AND BIG DATA, RUC](http://isbd.ruc.edu.cn/).

Only the main theory will be discussed here. (To facilitate my review QAQ.)
